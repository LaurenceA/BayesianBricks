TODOs:
  allow for reduced-rank mass matricies
  allow minibatching 
  docs

  examples:
    neural firing
    calcium? (Exponential + threshold).
    flips in 
    
    
Gamma priors:
  scale: 
    has Gamma conjugate prior
    equals var/mean, and can thus be viewed as a dispersion parameter.
  mean: 
    resonable to use a Gamma prior
  shape:
    obtain using mean / scale

testing


lapses:
  slow, multiplicative drift

noisy accumulator:
  convolution for speed

diffusion to bound (explicit):
  discretise time
  binary variables (stop/don't stop) for each time-point
    these binary variables are observed (give the reaction time)
    use a fairly sharp sigmoid for the top and bottom
    initialize as a straight line from start point to decision

diffusion to bound (integrated):

kalman filter:
  

discrete confidence (e.g. 1-6)
  parameterise thresholds as:
    discrete distribution over 1-6 (but not equal to the marginal dist. over confidences)
    assume a distriubtion (e.g. Gaussian) over confidences (not equal to the marginal dist)
    back solve for the thresholds
